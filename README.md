## What is Summit? 📝
An open source project to help summarise text or voice inputs.

## Why use Summit? 🤔
<b>Meetings, recordings, speeches, essays, anything too much information can always get boring! Would it not be awesome to know the summary and the keypoints only?</b>
* An average human being has an attention span of <b>8 seconds</b> only. As such for meetings, or recorded videos, it becomes pretty tedious to listen for hours. 
* When the meeting is important, this becomes a grave issue, because it's just obvious that one might miss essential points.
* For long texts, or essays, summarisation is an important technique, since it gives you the required points only.

## How to use Summit 💡
* We give you <b>Summit</b> a fully automated and ML powered website, that can listen to your audio, or take text inputs and then summarise.
* With Summit, you can get done with all the attention span, or excessive information issues, and have an awesome expereince.

## USP 🎉
This will be the first *Open Source* project of it's kind. It'll also be easily accessible to everyone and applicable in a wide variety of scenarios as mentioned already.
